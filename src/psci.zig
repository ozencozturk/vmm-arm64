//! psci.zig — the PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface) firmware ABI.
//!
//! Unlike every other guest interaction so far, this is not a memory access that
//! faulted: it is a FUNCTION CALL into a higher exception level. The guest kernel
//! executes `hvc #0` and traps to EL2 with ESR_EL2.EC = 0x16. Nothing is mapped,
//! no address faults, and `exit.physical_address` is meaningless here.
//!
//! The register contract is SMCCC's, not ours: w0 carries the Function ID in and
//! the return value out; x1..x3 carry arguments. That is why `handle` reads GPR 0
//! and writes GPR 0, and why it needs nothing from Machine — which keeps this file
//! HVF-free and fully unit-testable, unlike gic.zig.
//!
//! THE LANDMINE, and it INVERTS the EC 0x18 path next door: do NOT advancePc()
//! after an HVC. A *trap* leaves the PC on the faulting instruction, so serviceSysReg
//! must step over it. A *call* has already moved past it — the ELR points at the
//! instruction after the `hvc`. Advancing anyway silently skips one instruction of
//! kernel code. KVM encodes the same asymmetry: handle_hvc does not increment,
//! handle_smc does.
